# Coronavirus Global Cases - Geospatial Analysis

This project was developed by Eduardo Passos, and this map time series aims to represent the global spread of coronavirus in a visual way only with graduated symbols per country. No numbers, because we all already know the numbers. The goal here is to be minimalist.

To create this, I used the open source software QGIS, I download the dataset from Johns Hopkins University on Github, I plotted the .csv file to represent the cases on the map and build a timelapse by cases reported date.
